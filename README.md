# Programming_Python
This includes codes I wrote when I was learning python
There are 11 python files. 

## Lab 1  includes rock paper scissors game simulation. 
Using functions, libraries such as random and conditions and loop, I created this prrogram. You can play rock, paper scissors. 

## Lab 2: Object Oriented Programming.
 I created 6 object class. Using loop and interactive model, use can tell if they wish to enter in data for a human, hiker,scientist, swimmer or a  scientificswimmer, or if they would like to exit the program.

## Lab 3 : Numpy for data aggregation and analysis. 
Data were originally in csv format that were converted to pandas dataframe.

## Lab 4: Data Aggregation: 
Using column wise, rows wise analysis in python 

## Lab 5: Using beautiful soup to webscrap movi list from IMDB.
URL used: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=tv_series&num_votes=,100000&sort=runtime,asc
    It is an IMDB website search result for TV series with num of votes no more than 100,000 and the search result is sorted on runtime duration in ascending order.

Converted this webscrap into python dataframe for further analysis like: movies and their total run time, grouped movies based on director and calculate the total review stars etc. 

## Lab 6: Data cleaning and data wrangling.
Replacing missing values, removing/aggregating columns based on need, data visulization to discover outliers, merging data sheets etc. 

## Lab 7: Data Aggregation and analysis 
Pivot the data, index/label,reshape and crosstab based on conditions.

## Lab 8: Data Visualization and Data Exploration
 Line chart, Bar chart, Histogra, box plot for data explorations.
