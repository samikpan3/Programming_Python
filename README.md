# Programming_Python
This includes codes I wrote when I was learning python
There are 11 python files. 

## Lab 1  includes rock paper scissors game simulation. Using functions, libraries such as random and conditions and loop, I created this prrogram. You can play rock, paper scissors. 

## Lab 2 uses Object Oriented Programming. I created 6 object class. Using loop and interactive model, use can tell if they wish to enter in data for a human, hiker,scientist, swimmer or a  scientificswimmer, or if they would like to exit the program.

## Lab 3 includes using library numpy to aggregate and analysis data that were originally in csv format.

## Lab 4 using column wise, rows wise analysis in python 

## Lab 5: Using beautiful soup to webscrap movi list from IMDB.
URL used: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=tv_series&num_votes=,100000&sort=runtime,asc
    It is an IMDB website search result for TV series with num of votes no more than 100,000 and the search result is sorted on runtime duration in ascending order.
Converted this webscrap into python dataframe for further analysis like: movies and their total run time, grouped movies based on director and calculate the total review stars etc. 

## Lab 6: Data cleaning and data wrangling using Python Pandas. Replacing missing values, removing/aggregating columns based on need, data visulization to discover outliers, merging data sheets etc. 

## lab 7: Data Aggregation and analysis using Python. Pivot the data, index/label,reshape and crosstab based on conditions.

## lab 8: Data Visualization in Python: Line chart, Bar chart, Histogra, box plot for data explorations.
